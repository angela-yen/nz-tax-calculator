  # Note: Initial sudo code to understand tax bracket.
  #       When you earn within the bracket, it gets taxed at that rate and any value above the bracket will
  #       get taxed at the higher bracket. However, this is incremental to the earnings. i.e. if I earned
  #       $60000, I would get taxed at 10.5% for the first $15600, then 17.5% for next $37899, then at 30% for
  #       the remainder $6501.
